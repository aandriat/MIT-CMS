The MitEwk5TeV is a suite of analysis tools for W/Z cross-section measurement at 5 TeV.

Largely based on MitEwk13TeV at https://github.com/MiT-HEP/MitEwk13TeV

Utils contains helper functions for the rest of the folder

Flat_Ntuples is a sample of how to make flat ntuples from Bacon samples

GenAcceptance calculates the gen-particle acceptance by making signal selection at gen-level on Bacon samples, storing as flat ntuples, and then applying kinematic cuts
